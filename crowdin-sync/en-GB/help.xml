    <string name="add_new_author"><h2>Users: Add new author</h2>
<p>A password, welcome message and login instructions will be emailed to the new author.</p></string>
    <string name="admin_side_plugins"><h1>Preferences: Use admin-side plugins?</h1>
<p>Admin-side plugins can change the operation of the administration interface. They might hook into already existing actions, like editing or publishing articles, or they might add new panels for added/extended functionality.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about admin-side plugins, please see the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/development/">Extending Textpattern</a> page in <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/">Textpattern User Documentation</a>. Plugins of all sorts are listed in the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://textpattern.org/">Textpattern Resources</a> site.</p></string>
    <string name="remember_login"><h2>Remember login</h2>
<p>When checked, you will remain logged in to your Textpattern account with the current web browser, until you choose to log out. If left unchecked, you will be automatically logged out after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>Requires cookies to be enabled in your browser.</p></string>
    <string name="article_image"><h2>Write: Article image</h2>
<p>If you would like to associate a single image with this article, place one of the following here:</p>
<ol>
    <li>a Textpattern image ID</li>
    <li>a relative URL to the image (e.g. <code>/images/my_pic.jpg</code>)</li>
    <li>a fully-qualified URL (e.g. <code>http://example.com/path/to/images/my_pic.jpg</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The image can be displayed by placing a <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/article_image"><code>&lt;txp:article_image /&gt;</code> tag <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> inside an article form. It will output a complete HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to your chosen image.</p></string>
    <string name="body"><h2>Write: Body</h2>
<p>The main content of an article is contained within the article body.</p>
<p>When composing or preparing articles for publication in Textpattern, you can switch between three views of the article: plain text, HTML markup (the code with which a web browser renders the article), and a rendered preview.</p></string>
    <string name="description"><h2>Write: Description</h2>
<p>The article description is an optional component that can help search engines and website crawlers better identify and sort content.</p>
<p>The article description is limited to a maximum of 255 characters. Note that some search engines place character limits on the length of a page’s <code>meta description</code> for practicality of display in search engine results pages (SERPs) and this may be less than the 255 character limit in Textpattern.</p>
<p>Note that the article description differs from the article excerpt, though they both accept similar content. The article description should be primarily intended for use with search engines and crawlers, whereas the the article excerpt is more suited for a human-readable article summary where desired.</p></string>
    <string name="excerpt"><h2>Write: Excerpt</h2>
<p>Article excerpts are optional. Excerpts could be used as a short summary of the article that is displayed as part of a table of contents, used in place of the full article body in the site’s RSS/Atom feeds, or a number of other uses.</p></string>
    <string name="expire_date"><h2>Write: Expire date</h2>
<p>The time an article is labelled as expired. The time is optional and can be set to an arbitrary time in the past or future.</p>
<p>The boxes correspond to the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Year / Month / Day</li>
    <li>Hour (24-hour format) : Minute : Second</li>
</ul>
<p>When the time arrives, or in the case where a time in the past is provided, the article expires.</p>
<p>If the option to display expired articles is enabled, the article remains visible. If the option to display expired articles is disabled, visitors to the article page will be served an HTTP 410 error in place of the article content.</p></string>
    <string name="keywords"><h2>Write: Keywords</h2>
<p>Keywords are useful for refining the relationships between articles beyond those provided by categories.</p>
<p>Keywords must be individual words separated by commas.</p></string>
    <string name="override_form"><h2>Write: Override form</h2>
<p>If you wish for an article to use a form different from that assigned by default - for example if you want to show only an article excerpt with <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/excerpt"><code>&lt;txp:excerpt /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> where you normally show the entire article with <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/body"><code>&lt;txp:body /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> - this can be set here.</p></string>
    <string name="publish_date"><h2>Write: Publish date</h2>
<p>The time an article or file is published or most-recently revised. The time can be set to the moment the item is published, or to an arbitrary time in the past or future.</p>
<p>The boxes correspond to the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Year / Month / Day</li>
    <li>Hour (24-hour format) : Minute : Second</li>
</ul>
<p>An item with a timestamp greater than the current time (i.e. in the future) will not appear on the front end and the RSS/Atom feeds until that time arrives.</p></string>
    <string name="title"><h2>Write: Title</h2>
<p>Add an appropriate title for this article.</p>
<p>An article title is limited to a maximum of 255 characters.</p></string>
    <string name="url_title"><h2>Write: URL-only title</h2>
<p>If you would like to have a specific title attached to the permalink URL for your article, enter it here. If it is left blank, the URL title will be automatically generated from the article title.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful if the title of your article uses non-ASCII characters.</p></string>
    <string name="article_category"><h2>Categories: Articles</h2>
<p>Unlike sections, which define the navigational structure of a site, article categories allow organization of articles by their subject matter. Once categories are assigned, lists of articles belonging to particular categories can be browsed.</p>
<p>For example, likely article categories on a site about food might be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>raw ingredients</li>
    <li>shopping</li>
    <li>recipes</li>
    <li>presentation</li>
    <li>restaurants</li>
    <li>chefs</li>
</ul></string>
    <string name="category_description"><h2>Categories: Description</h2>
<p>The category description is an optional component that can help search engines and website crawlers better identify and sort content.</p>
<p>The category description is limited to a maximum of 255 characters. Note that some search engines place character limits on the length of a page’s <code>meta description</code> for practicality of display in search engine results pages (SERPs) and this may be less than the 255 character limit in Textpattern.</p></string>
    <string name="file_category"><h2>Categories: Files</h2>
<p>File categories are optional, and are useful if you want to group certain uploaded files together.</p></string>
    <string name="image_category"><h2>Categories: Images</h2>
<p>Image categories are useful both for internal organization, and for defining image sets that can be displayed using the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/image_index"><code>&lt;txp:image_index /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> and <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/image_display"><code>&lt;txp:image_display /&gt;</code> <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> tags.</p></string>
    <string name="link_category"><h2>Categories: Links</h2>
<p>Link categories are optional, and are useful if you want to display different groupings of links, e.g. ‘Friends’, ‘Romans’, ‘Countrymen’.</p>
<p>Selective link lists such as these are output with the <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/linklist"><code>&lt;txp:linklist /&gt;</code> tag <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;txp:linklist category="Friends" /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.</code></pre></string>
    <string name="clean_url_data_failed"><h2>Diagnostics: Clean URL data failed</h2>
<p>It appears that either your site URLs (<code>http://example.com/section/article</code>) are currently not working or your server does not support the test procedure to determine if clean URLs work or not; if clean URLs on your site work, you can safely ignore this message.</p>
<p>If clean URLs are <em>not</em> working it may mean either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your ‘Site URL’ setting is incorrect, or the page at that address is not managed by this copy of Textpattern.</li>
    <li>your server requires some changes to <code>.htaccess</code> in order to make clean URLs work.</li>
    <li>your server doesn’t support clean URLs at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clean URL test attempts to fetch a page from the web address specified in the ‘Site URL’ preference in order to check that all clean URL parameters are working correctly. If that URL is a different site, or has been replaced with a static page or similar, the test will fail. Until the issue is resolved you will have to use messy URLs on your site instead (<code>http://example.com?s=section&amp;id=4</code>). Ensure the ‘Permanent link mode’ in Admin Preferences is set accordingly.</p>
<p>Note that using a plugin to put a site in ‘maintenance mode’ may trigger this warning.</p></string>
    <string name="clean_url_test_failed"><h2>Diagnostics: Clean URL test failed</h2>
<p>It appears that either your site URLs (<code>http://example.com/section/article</code>) are currently not working or your server does not support the test procedure to determine if clean URLs work or not; if clean URLs on your site work, you can safely ignore this message.</p>
<p>If clean URLs are not working it may mean either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your ‘Site URL’ setting is incorrect, or the page at that address is not managed by this copy of Textpattern</li>
    <li>your server requires some changes to <code>.htaccess</code> in order to make clean URLs work</li>

    <string name="cleanurl_only_apache"><h2>Diagnostics: Clean URL support</h2>
<p>Clean URLs are only supported on Apache. If you are using another server platform, use short URLs at your own risk.</p>
</string>
    <string name="dev_version_live"><h2>Diagnostics: Development code on a live server</h2>
<p>You are running in-development files on a live production site which is not recommended. If you know this already and are happy to do so, you may ignore this warning.</p></string>
    <string name="dir_not_writable"><h2>Diagnostics: Directory is not writable</h2>
<p>To use the file and image upload capabilities, these directories have to be writable by PHP. Usually this means you have to change permissions so the web server user has write access to the directory. This can be done with your FTP client, or alternatively on the command line by issuing a <code>chmod 755 /path/to/dir</code> command.</p></string>
    <string name="dns_lookup_fails"><h2>Diagnostics: DNS fails</h2>
<p>It appears the URL you specified as the address of your site is unreachable.</p></string>
    <string name="file_uploads_disabled"><h2>Diagnostics: File uploads are disabled</h2>
<p>Your current server configuration shows that file uploads are disabled so you will not be able to upload using Textpattern’s ‘Files’ and/or ‘Images’ panel. Please check and alter the <code>file_uploads</code> setting in <code>php.ini</code> (or ask your host to alter it).</p></string>
    <string name="htaccess_missing"><h2>Diagnostics: .htaccess file missing</h2>
<p>You are using a permanent link mode which requires an <code>.htaccess</code> file to be placed in your site root directory. The recommended directives are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    #RewriteBase /relative/web/path/
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
    RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization}  !^$
    RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre></string>
    <string name="index_inaccessible"><h2>Diagnostics: Site index inaccessible</h2>
<p>The main <code>index.php</code> file specified as the index for your site is unreadable by the server. Please check permissions.</p></string>
    <string name="missing_files"><h2>Diagnostics: Missing files</h2>
<p>Some essential files are missing from your Textpattern installation. Ensure that all the listed files are present on your server and are in the correct locations.</p></string>
