h1. Textpattern CMS language files

!https://travis-ci.org/textpattern/textpacks.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/textpattern/textpacks

This repository contains Textpacks for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com. Textpacks are the translation file format Textpattern will eventually use in a future version.

h2. Contributing via Crowdin (preferred method)

Every translated string makes Textpattern better! The easiest way to get involved with translating the project is to use "Crowdin":http://translate.textpattern.io/. The tools they provide make translating Textpattern as easy as possible.

h2. Contributing via GitHub

To make corrections to existing translations, or to add new ones, "fork the repository":https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo, make your changes and commit to your fork. Once you are done, open "a pull request":https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. To boost workflow the repository contains synchronisation scripts and automated tests.

h3. Contributing via GitHub web editor

GitHub's "web based editing features":https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository allow you to easily do smaller edits to existing translations without you needing to delve into git. Changing files through the web interface isn't really recommended, but it's an option for those that do not use git, or are away from their computer.

To contribute to a translation directly from GitHub.com website:

# "Sign in":https://github.com/login with your GitHub account
# Navigate to a Textpack file you want to alter, e.g. "textpacks/en-gb.textpack":https://github.com/textpattern/textpacks/blob/master/textpacks/en-gb.textpack.
# Click or tap the *Edit* button above the presented file contents.
# Make some alterations to existing strings. Please, don't remove or add any string.
# After you've done, fill in the short commit message describing the change, e.g. _"Fixed typo in the name string"_.
# Click or tap the *Save* button.

Now to submit in a new pull request with your changes:

# Click or tap the *Click to create a pull request for this comparison* link on the page presented to you after saving, or you can use the *Compare and pull request* button on your fork's repository page.
# Fill in the comment field; explain what your changes do. Be precise and clear.
# Click or tap the *Send pull request* button.

Once your pull request is processed and marked closed (merged or denied), go back to your GitHub profile page and delete your clone of the Textpacks repository:

# Find the _textpacks_ repository on your profile page; it should be listed on your repository list.
# Open it.
# On the repository's page, click or tap the *Settings* link.
# Scroll down until you see *Delete repository* button.
# Click or tap it and confirm the action.

h2. Developing

h3. Adding and removing strings

Adding and removing strings happens through the main translation file, @en-gb.textpack@. Open up the file and add or remove strings as needed (remember to place new strings where they belong). Once you are done, run the sync tool:

bc. $ ./textpack

The Textpack tool will sync your alterations to all other Textpack files. It creates new empty strings and removes anything that is no longer present in the root translation.

h3. Creating new translation

When creating entirely new translations, always use the @en-gb.textpack@ as your template and reference point - this file is always up-to-date.

h3. Creating new empty template

Start by creating a new empty Textpack file:

bc. $ touch textpacks/xx-xx.textpack

Then run the Textpack sync tool:

bc. $ ./textpack

This will populate your empty @xx-xx.textpack@ file with an empty Textpack template.

h3. Updating an existing translation

After running the sync tool, any new strings will be empty - you have to compare it with @en-gb.textpack@ in order to review and update it, which can prove laborious. The tip below will help you translate new strings. *Note:* Commit everything before you do it!

First, filter all new strings:

bc. $ grep " =>[[:blank:]]*$" xx-xx.textpack | \
xargs -n1 printf "grep '^%s =>' en-gb.textpack\n" | \
bash > xx-xx.txt

Then, delete untranslated lines:

bc. $ sed -i '/ =>[[:blank:]]*$/d' xx-xx.textpack

This will leave you with just the new/empty strings. Edit @xx-xx.txt@ in your favourite editor, then append the strings at the end of the original @xx-xx.textpack@. Finally, run the sync tool and test:

bc. $ ./textpack
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit

h3. Testing

The project uses "PHPunit":http://phpunit.de for running its unit tests. Before running the tests, make sure you have installed dev-requirements using "Composer":http://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer install --dev

To run a test:

bc. $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
