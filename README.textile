h1. Textpattern CMS language files

!https://travis-ci.org/textpattern/textpacks.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/textpattern/textpacks

This repository contains Textpacks for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com. Textpacks are the translation file format Textpattern will eventually use in a future version.

h2. Contributing

To make corrections to existing translations, or to add new ones, "fork the repository":https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo. Once you are done, send in "a pull request":https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. To boost workflow the repository contains synchronisation scripts and automated tests.

h3. Adding and removing strings

Adding and removing strings happens through the main translation file, @en-gb.textpack@. Open up the file and add or remove strings as needed (remember to place new strings where they belong). Once you are done, run the sync tool:

bc. $ ./textpack

The Textpack tool will sync your alterations to all other Textpack files. It creates new empty strings and removes anything that is no longer present in the root translation.

h3. Creating new translation

When creating entirely new translations, always use the @en-gb.textpack@ as your template and reference point - this file is always up to date.

h3. Creating new empty template

Start by creating a new empty Textpack file:

bc. $ touch textpacks/xx-xx.textpack

Then run the Textpack sync tool:

bc. $ ./textpack

This will populate your empty @xx-xx.textpack@ file with an empty Textpack template.

h3. Testing

The project uses "PHPunit":http://phpunit.de for running its unit tests. Before running the tests, make sure you have installed dev-requirements using "Composer":http://getcomposer.org:

bc. $ composer install --dev

To run a test:

bc. $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
