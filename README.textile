h1. Textpattern CMS language files

This repository contains Textpacks for "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com. Textpacks are the translation file format Textpattern uses.

h2. Contributing

To boost workflow the repository contains a synchronization scripts and automated tests.

h3. Adding and removing strings

Adding and removing strings happens through the main translation file, @en-gb.textpack@. Open up the file, and add or remove strings as needed. Remember to place new strings where they belong. Once you're done, run the sync tool:

bc. $ ./textpack

The Textpack tool will sync your alterations to all other Textpack files. It creates new empty strings and removes anything that is no longer present in the root translation.

h3. Creating new translation

When creating entirely new translations, use the @en-gb.textpack@ as your template.
